Write a program in C to print all the Armstrong number from 1 to 500. 
An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of 
its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
another example is 370, because 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370.
