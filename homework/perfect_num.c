/*
Write a function to find all perfect numbers from 1 to 100 (perfect numbers are positive 
integers where the sum of perfect divisor is the number itself, e.g., 6 = 1+2+3). 

more examples of perfect number -> 28 as 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28,
and 496 as 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +31 + 62 + 124 + 248 = 496.
