## Operators

Operators in C programming are `symbol`s that instruct the `compiler` to `perform` specific `mathematical`, `relational` or `logical` functions on operands. 

The `operators` works with `operands` . 
The operands are the values or variables on which the operators act.

a = 5 ; 
b = 10;
sum = a `+` b; // `+` is the operator and `a` and `b` are operands.

sum = 5 + 10; // `+` is the operator and `5` and `10` are operands.
# Binary operators

`Binary` operators are operators that work on two operands.
ex:     `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`;


# Types of Operators in C 

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values (either literals or variables).


| Operator | Description | Syntax
| ---      | ---         | ----
| `+`      | Addition    | a + b
| `-`      | Subtraction | a - b
| `*`      | Multiplication | a * b
| `/` | Division | a / b
| `%` | remainder  | a % b
| `++` | Increment |  a++ or b++ 
| `--` | Decrement | a-- or b--


## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values (either literals or variables). They return a boolean value (true or false).

| Operator | Description | Syntax
| ---      | ---         | ----
| `==` | Equal to | a == b // 8 == 9 
| `!=` | Not equal to | a != b
| `<` | Less than | a < b
| `>` | Greater than | a > b
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | a <= b
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | a >= b
